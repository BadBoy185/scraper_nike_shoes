# scraper\_nike\_shoes

A standalone Scrapy script (`nike_scraper.py`) for collecting detailed information about Nike sneakers from the CZ (Czech) catalog.

Since only the `nike_scraper.py` file is provided, you will need to set up the Python environment and dependencies before running the scraper

---

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

1. **Install Scrapy**
   Install Scrapy and other core dependencies via pip:

   ```bash
   pip install scrapy
   ```

   If you donâ€™t have pip or virtualenv, see [https://docs.python.org/3/installing/#installing-packages](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/#installing-packages), and for full Scrapy documentation and tutorials visit [https://scrapy.org/](https://scrapy.org/).

2. **Download the Script**
   Place `nike_scraper.py` into your working directory (or clone the repo above).

3. **Run the Scraper**
   Use Scrapyâ€™s `runspider` command

   ```bash
   scrapy runspider nike_scraper.py -o items.json
   ```

   This will execute the embedded spider in `nike_scraper.py` and output to `items.json`.

4. **Check Results**
   Inspect `items.json` to verify all products have been collected.
